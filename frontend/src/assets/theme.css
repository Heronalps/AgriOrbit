/* 
  This file serves as an aggregator for the theme partials.
  Styles have been moved to their respective files:
  - _variables.css: CSS custom properties (theme variables).
  - _base.css: Base HTML element styles and global .p-component defaults.
  - _components.css: Styles for PrimeVue components and custom application components.
  - _utilities.css: Utility classes for reuse across the application.

  If any global overrides or styles that don't fit into the above categories
  are needed, they can be placed here. However, the preference is to keep this
  file minimal.
